# About

A collection of ordinal notations expansion scripts.  
Each notation script contains these functions:

| Name | Description
| - | -
| milestones | A map containing milestones analysis
| parse(ord) | Parse *ord* into a string and possibly add syntaxic sugar
| isSucc(ord) | Return if *ord* is a successor
| rank(a, b) | Return if *a* is strictly above *b*
| getLimit(num) | Get the *num*-th term of the fundamental sequence of the notation limit
| expand(ord, num) | Get the *num*-th term of the fundamental sequence of *ord*

Each script also imports functions from `utils.js` and has a test log.  
The lenght of a script is the number of nonempty lines in the explorer and expansion sections.

# Rules

## Modules

### Coding

- Internal structure must be an array containing **only** natural numbers
- **No** iterative object methods inside explorer and expansion sections
- Expansion function must mutate *ord*
- Time complexity must be optimal
- Parsed notations must **not** contain spaces
- Ignore zero expansion
- **No** recursion
- Split long functions

### Formatting

- Each line must have **at most** 64 characters
- Functions and statements followed by braces must **not** break line
- Arrow functions must be function arguments
- Each function must **not** nest while and for loops
- Merge similar functions
- Write shorthands for frequently used variables
- Avoid more than 64 characters per line
- Each instruction must end with a semicolon

## Accepted notations

- **Not** overcomplicated
- Must append and pop at the right
- Skip notations with similar expansion
- Avoid weak trivial extentions

## Creating notations

- Extend limit
- Compress length
- Map down
- Simplify expansion

# Notations complexity

## General

The complexity is the tokens count in the expansion and limit sections.
